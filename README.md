#Tic Tac Toe

This was built in Go and utilizes a command line interface.

##Instructions

To start, type the following into the command prompt.

```

It will ask for the size of the board. As of right now, only 3 X 3 works efficiently. 4 X 4 works after approximately 4 seconds for the first move. Afterwards, the computer responds instantly.

The numbers 1 through 9 correspond to each individual square. Like so:

```
1 2 3
4 5 6
7 8 9
```

The game will ask for your move. Simply enter the number that corresponds to the square you wish to mark. The available moves are listed at the bottom.
